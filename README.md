# This app uses React, Redux, React Router, and many other helpful libraries.

- The app uses Material UI for styling. It heavily utilizes the free template offered here:

  - https://material-ui.com/getting-started/templates/dashboard/
  - https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/getting-started/templates/dashboard

- TODO: testing framework

- The app is deployed at:
  - https://router-spa.appspot.com/
  - Because of high RAM requirement (~530MB) to run a single instance (???), the app's instance is mostly shutdown and may take a while to startup and serve
